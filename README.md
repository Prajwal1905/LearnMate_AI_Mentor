#🎓 LearnMate AI Mentor
An AI-powered mentor built using IBM Watsonx.ai to help students discover and follow personalized learning pathways. LearnMate understands students’ interests, evaluates their current skill level, and generates adaptive course roadmaps in real time for domains like Frontend Development, Cybersecurity, UI/UX, and more.

#🧩 Problem Statement
 Agentic AI for Personalized Course Pathways

Students often feel lost in the sea of online resources. Without structured, personalized guidance, they struggle to identify the most suitable learning path that aligns with their career goals. This results in time wasted, low course completion rates, and lack of clarity in skill development.

#💡 Proposed Solution
LearnMate is an Agentic AI coach powered by IBM Watsonx.ai and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It interacts naturally with students to understand their preferences and goals, then creates a customized, evolving course roadmap. It also adapts based on feedback and learning progress, making career building more focused and efficient.
