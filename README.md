# LearnMate AI Mentor
An AI-powered mentor built using IBM Watsonx.ai to help students discover and follow personalized learning pathways. LearnMate understands students’ interests, evaluates their current skill level, and generates adaptive course roadmaps in real time for domains like Frontend Development, Cybersecurity, UI/UX, and more.

## Problem Statement
 Agentic AI for Personalized Course Pathways

Students often feel lost in the sea of online resources. Without structured, personalized guidance, they struggle to identify the most suitable learning path that aligns with their career goals. This results in time wasted, low course completion rates, and lack of clarity in skill development.

## Proposed Solution
LearnMate is an Agentic AI coach powered by IBM Watsonx.ai and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It interacts naturally with students to understand their preferences and goals, then creates a customized, evolving course roadmap. It also adapts based on feedback and learning progress, making career building more focused and efficient.

## Technologies Used
IBM Watsonx.ai Studio
IBM Granite Foundation Model (LLM)
Vector Index for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## IBM Cloud Services Used
Watsonx.ai Studio
IBM Granite Model
Watsonx Vector Index
IBM Cloud Object Storage
IBM Cloud Lite Account
IBM IAM (Access Management)

## Target Users
University students
Early-career professionals
Career switchers
School students exploring technology
Educators & guidance counselors
Self-learners and upskillers

## WOW Factors
🔍 Personalized learning roadmap generation
🧠 Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation with real course data
🌐 Handles both tech (e.g. Cybersecurity, ML) and non-tech pathways
🎯 Aligns with career goals & interests through conversation
📚 Dynamic roadmap updates based on learning progress
💬 Graceful handling of irrelevant queries
🌎 Future-ready with multilingual and mobile support
🛡️ Fully built using IBM Cloud Lite & Watsonx.ai services

## Key Features
Conversational skill assessment and interest mapping
Adaptive course roadmap building
Natural-language Q&A for roadmap clarification
Vector Index-based RAG over curated learning content
